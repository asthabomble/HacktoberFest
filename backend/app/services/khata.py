The writing may be Hindi, Marathi, English or mixed, in Devanagari or Latin script, with Devanagari (०-९) or Western digits.

Extract every credit/payment line as a row:
- written_name: ONLY the person's name exactly as written, e.g. "Rmsh" or "सुनीता" (keep the original
  script, do not translate). No items, no amounts, no words like jama/udhaar.
  If the page has one name as a heading and the lines below are that person's items, use that name for every row.
- customer_name: if the written name (or its shorthand below) clearly refers to one of this shop's existing
  customers, that customer's exact name from the list; otherwise the same as written_name.
- amount: the rupee amount as a number (convert Devanagari digits to Western digits).
- type:
    "gave" = shopkeeper gave goods/money on credit (udhaar, baaki, diya, नावे, उधार, बाकी, दिया, or an item purchase).
    "got"  = shopkeeper received payment (jama, mila, aaya, जमा, मिला, आया, "paid", "rcvd").
    If there are two columns, the left/"नावे" column is usually "gave" and the "जमा" column is "got".
- date: YYYY-MM-DD if a date is written on the line or as a heading above it, else null.
  Assume day/month order. If the year is missing, use {year}.
- raw_text: the line exactly as you read it, including item names.
- confidence: "high" only if name, amount and type are all clearly legible; otherwise "low".

Skip total/summary lines (कुल, टोटल, एकूण, total), headings with no amount, and lines that are crossed out.
If the image is not a khata page or nothing is readable, return {{"rows": []}}.
